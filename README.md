# Integrating Nabla Finance

Two modes of integration are possible:

- [Onchain quoting guide](onchain-quoting.md)
- [Offchain state replication and simulation guide](state-replication-and-simulationV1.md)
- [Offchain state replication and simulation guide for MONAD](state-replication-and-simulation-Monad.md)

While the onchain quoting is trivial to implement, the offchain state replication and simulation is better suited for Nabla's High Frequency Pricing engine and will result with greater volumes and revenues over time.

You can find the guides in this repo or by following the links above.
