# Integrating Nabla Finance

Two modes of integration are possible:

- [Onchain quoting guide](onchain-quoting.md)
- [Offchain state replication and simulation guide](state-replication-and-simulation.md)

While the later is trivial to implement, the former is better suited for Nabla's High Frequency Pricing engine and will result with greater volumes and revenues over time.

You can find the guides in this repo or by following the links above.
